Introduction
============

Tor is a great tool. You might want to create routers or servers which filter all passing traffic and send it through tor. On linux systems this can be done by creating the appropriate iptables rules. However one problem might arise: if users behind the firewall are already using tor/tails, their connections shouldn't be torified.

Torset is a tool that lets you create an ipset (see man ipset) for iptables to create the exception rules needed to let connections to tor nodes pass unhindered, while you can redirect anything else. Torset reads a microdescriptor consensus file (the default one at /var/lib/tor/cached-microdesc-consensus or a user supplied one) and creates the ipset with the name you specify on the command line.

You can then use --match-set in iptables. See: 'man iptables-extensions | grep -x "   set" -A53' for more explanation.


Installation
============

1. unpack if you got a tarball
2. cd into the project directory
3. ./configure
4. sudo make install



Usage
=====
running torset will tell you:

torset  : create or update an ipset from a tor microdescriptor consensus file.
Version : 2013.11.04.ALPHA - you are warned
Usage   : torset setname [ consensusFile ]

consensusFile defaults to '/var/lib/tor/cached-microdesc-consensus' in which case
you will need root privileges.
